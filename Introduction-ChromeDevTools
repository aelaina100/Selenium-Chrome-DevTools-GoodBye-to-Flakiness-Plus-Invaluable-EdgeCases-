1- What is Chrome DevTools ?
2- What is Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) ?
3- For what purposes are Chrome DevTools used in automation ?
4- What is  the class hierarchy in Selenium 4.0 + ? 
5- What is  the class hierarchy before Selenium 4.0 ? 
6- Give an example on how Chrome DevTools help in reducing the need for test data ?

1- What is Chrome DevTools ?

Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome/Edge browser (Plus any other Chromium-based browsers).
With Chrome DevTools, developers have deeper access to the Applications that render on the browser.

To view Chrome DevTools in browser ======> 
Launch your Chrome or Edge browser > Right-click any where > Click on 'Inspect' > what comes up is the Chrome Developers Tools with the tabs of:	

-Elements
-Console (Displays UI console logs)
-Network (Where API requests/responses made by the web app are displayed)
-Performance ( Performance metrics are collected)
-Memory
-Application
-Security
-Plus many & many more tabs to acquire more info about the application !

So basically, this is what one uses in order to debug their web application (In order to get an insight on how it's functioning step by step).
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now imagine if Selenium can get an access to all of these tabs (features) of Chrome DevTools. This powerful move is feasible if you integrate Selenium 4.0 and up 
with Chrome DevTools. This means that Selenium is no longer a strictly UI automation tool. It now stretches to the realm of API, Performance, & Security testing plus acquiring 
additional powerful features such as reading console logs from the Console tab and much more.

********************** 2-  Now, what is Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)? (As opposed to Chrome DevTools) ?

Answer: 

It is the mechanism by which the Chrome DevTools UI feature in browser, 1- displays its info under the various tabs. 2- Enables the user to interact with this info (Ex: Clearing cache under the Network tab).
This CDP mechanism also happens to expose a huge list of methods (APIs) that can programmatically (Instead of manually in 1& 2 above) enable user to monitor the data and interact with it.

To view this huge list of methods (APIs) that CDP exposes ========>

Go to Chrome DevTools Protocol official website (Google it)- As of now it is: https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/
On the left-hand side under "Domains", these exist many sections corresponding to the tabs of the Chrome DevTools in browser.
Let's look at the section of, for example, "Network": These are methods of the Network Domain. 
For example:  "Network.clearBrowserCache" is a  method that clears browser cache instead of doing it manually in the Network tab of the Chrome DevTools in browser.  
              
              
              
                 Integrating Selenium with the Chrome DevTools feature has been made possible since the release of Selenium 4.0 version.
	                   As a result, this opens up lots of possibilities & opportunities to perform out-of-box testing with many edge/negative
	                                test case scenarios that are both powerful and meaningful in Selenium WebDriver.

                   [Remember: In the above structure (and always), "WebDriver" is the ONLY interface & "Remote WebDriver" is the class that implements this interface.]
                                        
**Chromium Driver has been introduced since Selenium 4.0: It contains all the automation methods of Chrome DevTools. Where  Chrome Driver / Edge Driver inherits directly from "Chromium Driver".

   		
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________
 B- For FireFox driver ( & any other non chromium-based browsers):========================>

       └─ WebDriver
                └─ Remote WebDriver

To access Chrome DevTools methods in Selenium 4.0 and above, use ===========>  

ChromeDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();  // 'ChromeDriver' on the left side is the 'Chromium Driver' class. containing all the methods of the Chrome DevTools. It also inherits ALL methods
                                              present in the Remote WebDriver class that implements the interface of WebDriver  ((Just look at the hierarchy illustrated above !).
                                                                
Instead of the usual:   WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver(); // Where you will NOT have an access to the methods of the Chrome DevTools (Just look at the hierarchy illustrated above !).

Chrome DevTools mitigates the challenge of acquiring test data and thereby reduces flakiness 
     

To begin grasping the usefulness of Chrome DevTools in automation, read the following scenarios:===========>
	
	A web page displays, by default, a number of records on its home page.
	These many displayed records are the results of some Json response, relayed by some API, to the client (Front end).
	Where this Json response has a number of sections each corresponding to some record displayed in the UI.
	
	Now, I have a scenario where I need to verify that some specific error message will only appear in the UI when only 1 record is displayed:
	The usual solution to that is to have an access to another account, where logging in will result in only 1 record being displayed where its associated
	error message should also be displayed.
	
	However, we know that one of the challenges in QA is procuring test data ( and procuring them on time shall I add, before the start of the sprint.
	It is still a challenge, even with the positive pre-assumption that this is going to be a possible/easy task !).
	
	And, assume that you've finally succeeded in procuring this test data before the start of the sprint...
	But what if you login at sometime in the future, only to discover that more than 1 record now exists ! (Where the error message, associated with
	1 record being present in the UI, no longer appears !). This is a very valid scenario and as a QA, one has to think in this fashion. As you can see,
	such a scenario introduces flakiness to your automated suite, of the false negative type [Script intended to run against one record but instead, an additional
	record(s) is now present.. regardless of why and how].
	
	To solve this issue and to, in general, overcome the challenge of procuring data in QA along with reducing flakiness in your automation project,
	                                      **** This is where Chrome DevTools automation come into picture ****
	
	Where, You're going to mock the Json response so that it only contains one section corresponding to ONLY one record being displayed in the UI.
	WITH once again only one account (without the need to have an additional account that even if acquired won't be reliable in the first place !).
	
		So with this ONE & ONLY Original single account that, by default, displays many records, one can =============>
		
		1- Build a Test case (Test NG method), without mocking the JSon response, handling a scenario involving the many records.
		2- Build a 2nd Test case (Test NG method) but with mocking the Json response so that ONLy 1 record is displayed so the error msg could be verified.
		3- Build a 3rd Test Case (Test NG method) but with a different way of mocking the Json response so that, for example, 2 very specific combinations of records
		   are ONLY displayed so that an associated feature can be verified, etc. etc.
